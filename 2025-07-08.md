# ðŸ§  Dev Log â€“ July 8, 2025

## âœ… What I Worked On
- Practiced Git CLI basics
- Set up dev-notes repo
- Set up portfolio repo for project links
- Pushed first few commits to GitHub
- markdown formatting

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
1. Git commands
- `git init` Initializes a new repo in the current directory and creates a .git folder where Git stores pertinent metadata
- `git add .` Allows you to stage all changed files in the current directory
- `git add -A` Stages all changes in the entire repository
- `git add <filename>` Stages a specific file
- `git commit -m "Commit message"` Commits staged changes with provided message
- `git status` Displays current state of working directory and staging area, showing modified, staged, and untracked files.
- `git log` Displays commit history of current branch, including hash, author, date, and message for each commit.
- How to change default branch
: Changed default branch to `main` from `master`
- `git branch <branch-name>` Creates a new branch with given name at the current commit. Does not switch to the branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>` Switches the current working branch to the given name, and updates files in working directory to reflect branch state.
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>` Shorthand for creating new branch and switch to it. Equivalent to `git branch <branch-name>` followed by `git checkout <new-branch-name>`.
- `git branch -d <branch-name>` Deletes branch with given name - usually done after the branch changes are merged into another branch.
- `git merge <branch-to-merge>` Integrates changs from given branch into currently checked-out branch. Git attempts to combine histories, while conflicts will need to be resolved prior to completing merge.
- `git merge --squash <branch-to-merge>` Combines all commits from given branch into a single commit on the current branch, "squashing" the history of the merged branch.
- `git push [remote] [branch-name]` Uploads local directory content to remote repo. Done after making changes, committing them locally, and potentially pulling to ensure branch is up-to-date, `git push` transfers committed changes to the given remote.
- `git pull [remote] [branch-name]` Fetches (downloads) content from remote and updates local repo to match content. This is effectively a `git fetch` (which downloads changes) and `git merge` (which applies changes to local branch), synchronizing local repo with latest remote changes.
- `git clone <repo url> [local directory]` Creates local copy of existing remote repository, including all branches and commits.

2. Markdown Syntax
- Basic syntax - very simple to understand. Headers are pound symbols/hashmarks, **bold** is double asterisks on each side, *italics* is single asterisks on each side, and ==highlighting== is double equal signs on each side (or <mark>a mark tag</mark> in some cases). Subscript (H~2~O) is tilde-surrounded, while superscript (X^2^) is carat-surrounded. Blockquotes are initiated with a greater-than sign, ordered lists are numbered while unordered are dash-initiated. Code is backtick surrounded, a horizontal rule is three dashes in a row, links are brackets for the title and parenthesis for the link itself, and an image is the same but with an exclamation point prepended. These and extended syntax (for things like tables, fenced code blocks, and footnotes) are all linked below.

## ðŸš§ What Confused/Intrigued Me
- What is rebase? When and why would I use it?
- What other, more advanced commands, will I need to learn and use? Why?
